Revision history for Perl extension CGI::TabPane.

1.02  Thu Jan 29 12:37:29 2004
	- Add parameter to new() called current_tab, to allow the user to specify which tab is to be the current tab
		when the first pane is displayed. See POD for details
	- Add parameter to new() called use_cookie, to allow the user to specify whether or not a cookie is used by the
		JavaScript to save the state of which tab is the current tab on the first pane. This option was suggested by
		Enrico Sorcinelli. See POD for details
	- Document limitations: 66 tabs per pane and 99 non-nested panes
	- Change call to new() in examples/test-cgi-tabpane.cgi to include these values:
		current_tab => 'Privacy',
		use_cookie  => 0
	- Fix typo in examples/test-cgi-tabpane.cgi. The parameter to new() was:
			style     => '/css/tabpane/webfx.css',
		and is now:
			style_css => '/css/tabpane/webfx.css',
	- Fix Makefile.PL to exclude DBI, because Makefile.PL was copied carelessly from another project, and to include
		Test::More, because the latter module is used in t/test.t

1.01  Mon Jan 25 12:37:29 2004
	- Fix class name in t/test.t. I copied the test from another module and did not edit it properly
	- Fix typos in luna.css: background-repaet is now background-repeat
	- Fix typo in this file: Tue (below) is now Sun

1.00  Sun Jan 25 12:37:29 2004
