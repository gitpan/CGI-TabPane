[V 1.04]
Date=2004-07-19T14:43:00
Comments= <<EOT
- Change Makefile.PL to coexist with Module::Build
- Move a few CSS declarations around between the *.css files to help clean these files up.
You should notice nothing
- Change the default margin and padding for forms from 0 to 5 pixels. See final.css lines 14 .. 15.
In this case you should now notice a coloured frame around your forms
- Note: Firefox V 0.9.1 fails to properly handle the CSS required to display multiple panes stacked
vertically when the last pane is wider than the panes above it. However it does better job than
IE V 6.0.2800 at handling the width of the tab on a pane with one tab below a pane of several tabs.
You are encouraged to report all bugs to the appropriate developers
- Add t/pod.t to test all PODs

Comments= <<EOT
- Add warning to docs that the CSS file given by the final_css parameter to new()
must follow in the <head> of the HTML the CSS file given by the style_css
parameter. Add corresponding comment to examples/test-cgi-tabpane.cgi
- Only add the infix_html between panes not also after the last pane as I was doing
- Cut all unused CSS selectors from *.css. This makes it much easier to combine this
module with other CSS files
- Change docs to recommend separating panes vertically by 1 paragraph rather than 2.
Since the CSS selector 'p' was cut from *.css your demos will change appearence
whether you use 1 or 2 paragraphs in this way

[V 1.02]
Date=2004-01-29T12:37:29
Comments= <<EOT
- Add parameter to new() called current_tab to allow the user to specify which tab is to be the current tab
when the first pane is displayed. See POD for details
- Add parameter to new() called use_cookie to allow the user to specify whether or not a cookie is used by the
JavaScript to save the state of which tab is the current tab on the first pane. This option was suggested by
Enrico Sorcinelli. See POD for details
- Document limitations: 66 tabs per pane and 99 non-nested panes
- Change call to new() in examples/test-cgi-tabpane.cgi to include these values:
current_tab => 'Privacy'
use_cookie => 0
- Fix typo in examples/test-cgi-tabpane.cgi. The parameter to new() was:
style => '/css/tabpane/webfx.css'
and is now:
style_css => '/css/tabpane/webfx.css'
- Fix Makefile.PL to exclude DBI because Makefile.PL was copied carelessly from another project and to include
Test::More because the latter module is used in t/test.t
